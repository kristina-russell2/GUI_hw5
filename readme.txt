My scrabble program is a bit barebones, but it has a rack,
it randomizes the map key to use which also helps with picking which
letter chip to use. I created a map that contains a letter and an
array that follows the format of value, startCount, and currCount that I could have
implemented the scoring/generation of the letters. The letter chips are draggable
and the scrabble board is snappable.
